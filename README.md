# What's my Color? #
* A mobile quiz game based on the Stroop Effect written in C# using the Unity engine for Android.
* Incorporates Google's Social, Leaderboards, and Achievements API.

# Features #
* Leaderboards to compare yourself to your friends and others
* Achievements because that's a game industry standard now
* Four game modes, 3 of which are unlockable
* Good UI design, such as: 

1. The giant "Sign in" button blocking access to Leaderboards and Achievements buttons to show what you need to do first.

2. The delay on the results screen's "Return to mode selection" button's activation to prevent the situation where a player attempts to on a bottom button during a game but time runs out, causing them to hit the "Return to mode selection" button on the next screen instead.
