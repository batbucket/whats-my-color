# Summary #
This repository holds the code for my Stroop effect-inspired mobile quiz game for Android. I'm proud of the fact that I was able to develop and finish a game from the beginning to the end that I can call mine on the Google Play store. I've learned a great deal about how Unity's component based scripting works, and the importance of adhering to an architectural pattern early on. I also now know how Google's Leaderboards and Achievements APIs work. Although my code hierarchy for this project doesn't match Model-View-Presenter perfectly, I hope to enforce a more stricter structure for my future Unity projects.
